# FoodBlogWebsite

**Concepts:** Network Applications, Static Web Development

**Software & Languages:** Apache Tomcat, HTML, CSS, Eclipse

**Packages:** N/A

**Description:** This basic website was a project I worked on and created in a network application and web development course at UGA. We were tasked with building static website based on minimal visual requirements. It is modeled from a food blog Instagram page I currently operate. It includes recipes, pictures, tips, and contact information. I have included a sample photo of the home page, but I recommend opening the index.html file to explore the site.
